    "In the last workshop, we have illustrated k-means clustering using the iris flower dataset. Put what you have learned into practice by applying it to our known cancer dataset. Focus only on a selected subset of features: ``radius_mean``, ``texture_mean``, ``concavity_mean``, and ``smoothness_mean``. Would you have chosen the true number of 2 clusters without knowing that there are only two cancer types? Do the following:\n",
    "- load and prepare data (including feature scaling)\n",
    "- Run k-means for different values of k using the selected features\n",
    "- select the most suitable k using the elbow method\n",
    "- re-train your model using your selected number for k\n",
    "- Generate two scatterplots: one showing the true label, and one showing your generated clusters (using the first two selected features for x and y)"
